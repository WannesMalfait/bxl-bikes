# Brussels Bikes

This is a project where I try to predict the number of bikes passing by a bike counting pole based on the current weather data. The data fetching and parsing is done using rust. The machine learning is done in python.

## Current results

Nothing yet. My model is still garbage.

## Thanks

Big thanks to [Brussels Mobility](https://data.mobility.brussels) for putting the data out there in a simple API.
